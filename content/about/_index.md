I'm a data, statistics, machine learning and visualization enthousiast (in random order).
I work at Statistics Netherlands (aka CBS), doing applied research with the intention of making
better Official Statistics, since CBS is the institute that produces many official 
statistics for the Netherlands.

By training I'm a theoretical/computational physicist so I like to turn solutions for
data problems into computer programs. Most of the times I use R, but when needed I
turn to other options as python, C++, scala or whatever gets the jobs done.
