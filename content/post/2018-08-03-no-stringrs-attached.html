<p>I just uploaded version 0.6 of <code>docopt</code> to CRAN, which was long overdue.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docopt/docopt.R">Docopt</a> is a R package that helps in parsing command-line
options of a R-script. The beauty of docopt is that it uses the help text (i.e. ‚Äú-h‚Äù) as its
specification, and then <code>docopt</code> uses this to create a command-line argument parser.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&#39;usage: my_prog.R [-a -r -m &lt;msg&gt;]

options:
 -a        Add
 -r        Remote
 -m &lt;msg&gt;  Message&#39; -&gt; doc

# load the docopt library
library(docopt)
# retrieve the command-line arguments
opts &lt;- docopt(doc)</code></pre>

<p>Besides some minor bug fixes (thanks contributors!), the most important thing is the removal
<code>docopt</code>‚Äôs dependency on <code>stringr</code> (and therefore <code>stringi</code>). <code>docopt</code> was a heavy user of <code>str_extract</code> and <code>str_match</code>, which are great. <code>stringr</code> is a very useful and
consistent package, which I use a lot in data munging. However as a package maintainer I have
other responsibilities. Besides providing useful and correct functionality a package should
be stable and lean. This is especially true for <code>docopt</code> since its use is with Rscripts that run in batch mode. Its foot print should be kept minimal.</p>
<p>Thanks to base R this is possible, but I am certainly not the first to notice :-)</p>

I try to write low dependency <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> pkgs, but this is only possible b/c R has so much built-in: stats, string manip, low/high level graphics, etc. And it is stable over time; a bedrock to build on. Me when I think about it: ü§Ø.<br><br>Thank you R-Core!
