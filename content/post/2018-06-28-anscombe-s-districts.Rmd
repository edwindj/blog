I'm a real fan of [Anscombe Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet). 
As intented by Francis Anscombe in 1973, they show that you never should
"blindly" use statistics, but check your implicit assumptions by making charts of your data. Furthermore 
Anscombes quartet also makes clear that you should check your data for outliers: they may heavily bias your result.

I often use the Quartet in introduction to datavisualisation courses, and start with slides showing the data,
their identical stats and ask the question if they think the four dataset are similar, before showing the plots.

As you may know `R` includes the anscombe data set in package `dataset`

```{r}
data("anscombe")
head(anscombe)
```
