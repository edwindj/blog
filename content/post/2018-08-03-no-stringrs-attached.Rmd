```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

I just uploaded a version 0.6 of `docopt`, which was long overdue.

[Docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.R) is an R package that helps in parsing command-line 
options of a R-script. The beauty of docopt is that it uses the help text (i.e. "-h") as its 
specification, and then `docopt` uses this to create a command-line argument parser. 

```r
'usage: my_prog.R [-a -r -m <msg>]

options:
 -a        Add
 -r        Remote
 -m <msg>  Message' -> doc

# load the docopt library
library(docopt)
# retrieve the command-line arguments
opts <- docopt(doc)
```

Besides some minor bug fixes (thanks contributors!), the most important thing is the removal 
`docopt`'s dependency on `stringr` (and therefore `stringi`). `docopt` was a heavy user of `str_extract` and `str_match`, which are great. `stringr` is a very useful and 
consistent package, which I use a lot in data munging. However as a package maintainer I have
other responsibilities. Besides providing useful and correct functionality a package should 
be stable and lean. This is especially true for `docopt` since its use is with Rscripts that run in batch mode. Its foot print should be kept minimal.

Thanks to base R this is possible, but I am certainly not the first to notice :-)
